# DSFR Fundamentals

## Mission
The DSFR aims to harmonize the digital ecosystem of the State, bringing **clarity** and **trust** to citizens.

## Core Values
### 1. Essential (Minimalist)
- **Goal**: Clear and understandable interfaces for everyone.
- **Practice**: Eliminate unnecessary complexity. Optimize user experience.

### 2. Inclusive (Universal)
- **Goal**: Leave no citizen behind (disabilities, old devices, slow connections).
- **Compliance**: **100% RGAA compliance** is mandatory.

### 3. Formal (Heritage)
- **Goal**: Reflect the State's heritage (Marianne, Flag, Motto).
- **Practice**: Maintain formalism. Avoid trying to look "trendy" or "fun" if it contradicts the State's brand.

## Application Rules
- **Completeness**: You must respect the fundamentals. No "cherry-picking" that breaks coherence.
- **Components**: **Must** use library components if they exist.
- **Creation**: Create new components **only** if they don't exist in the library (and contribute them back).
- **No Hijacking**: Do not divert components from their intended purpose.
- **No Overlays**: Do not add arbitrary graphical overlays.
