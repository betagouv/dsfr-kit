# Feature Specification: Monorepo Setup

**Feature Branch**: `001-monorepo-setup`  
**Created**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I would like to begin monorepo setup (Turborepo, pnpm, uv)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Initialize Monorepo Structure (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need to establish a monorepo workspace that can manage multiple related packages and applications in a single repository, enabling shared dependencies and coordinated builds.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for all subsequent development work. Without the basic monorepo structure, no other packages or applications can be organized or managed effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that the workspace root is properly configured, package manager recognizes the workspace structure, and a simple test package can be created and referenced by another package.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing repository, **When** the monorepo structure is initialized, **Then** workspace configuration files are created at the repository root
2. **Given** the monorepo structure is initialized, **When** listing workspace packages, **Then** the package manager correctly identifies all workspace members
3. **Given** a workspace with multiple packages, **When** one package depends on another workspace package, **Then** the dependency is resolved locally without requiring publication

### User Story 2 - Configure Build Orchestration (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need an automated build orchestration system that understands package dependencies and can execute builds in the correct order, with caching to avoid redundant work.

**Why this priority**: Once the monorepo structure exists, efficient builds become critical for developer productivity. This enables fast iteration and CI/CD pipelines.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating packages with interdependencies, triggering a build, and verifying that packages build in dependency order and subsequent builds use cached results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** packages with dependency relationships, **When** a build is triggered, **Then** packages are built in topological order (dependencies before dependents)
2. **Given** a successful build, **When** no source files change and build is triggered again, **Then** cached results are used and no rebuilding occurs
3. **Given** a change in one package, **When** a build is triggered, **Then** only affected packages and their dependents are rebuilt

---

### User Story 3 - Manage Multiple Language Ecosystems (Priority: P3)

As a developer working with both JavaScript/TypeScript and Python packages, I need the monorepo to support multiple language ecosystems with their respective package managers working harmoniously.

**Why this priority**: This enables polyglot development within the monorepo, allowing teams to use the best tools for each task while maintaining a unified repository structure.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating both JavaScript and Python packages in the workspace, installing dependencies for each, and verifying that both ecosystems function independently without conflicts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** JavaScript packages using pnpm, **When** installing dependencies, **Then** pnpm workspace features work correctly
2. **Given** Python packages using uv, **When** installing dependencies, **Then** uv manages Python packages without interfering with JavaScript packages
3. **Given** both JavaScript and Python packages, **When** running builds or scripts, **Then** each ecosystem uses its appropriate tooling

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a package has circular dependencies?
- How does the system handle packages with conflicting dependency versions?
- What happens when a build fails in one package of a multi-package build?
- How are workspace packages handled when they need to be published externally?
- What happens when switching between branches with different workspace structures?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support workspace-based package management where multiple packages can coexist in a single repository
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable local package references without requiring package publication
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide dependency hoisting to reduce duplication of shared dependencies
- **FR-004**: System MUST support build orchestration that respects package dependency graphs
- **FR-005**: System MUST cache build outputs to avoid redundant rebuilds when source files haven't changed
- **FR-006**: System MUST support incremental builds where only changed packages and their dependents are rebuilt
- **FR-007**: System MUST support parallel execution of independent build tasks
- **FR-008**: System MUST manage JavaScript/TypeScript packages using pnpm workspace features
- **FR-009**: System MUST manage Python packages using uv for dependency management
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow scripts to be run across all workspace packages or filtered subsets
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide clear error messages when builds fail, indicating which package failed
- **FR-012**: System MUST support development mode where changes in one package are immediately available to dependent packages

### Key Entities

- **Workspace Root**: The repository root containing workspace configuration, defining which directories contain packages and global settings for the monorepo
- **Package**: An individual unit of code (library or application) with its own dependencies, build configuration, and version, managed as part of the workspace
- **Build Pipeline**: The orchestrated sequence of build tasks across packages, respecting dependencies and utilizing caching
- **Dependency Graph**: The relationship map between packages showing which packages depend on which others, used to determine build order
- **Cache**: Storage of build outputs and intermediate artifacts keyed by input file hashes, enabling fast rebuilds

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can create a new package in the workspace and have it recognized by the package manager within 30 seconds
- **SC-002**: A full clean build of all packages completes successfully without errors
- **SC-003**: Subsequent builds with no changes complete in under 5 seconds using cached results
- **SC-004**: When a single package is modified, only that package and its dependents are rebuilt (verified by build logs)
- **SC-005**: Both JavaScript and Python packages can coexist in the workspace with their respective tooling functioning correctly
- **SC-006**: Developers can run workspace-wide commands (like linting or testing) that execute across all packages
- **SC-007**: The build system correctly identifies and reports dependency cycles if they exist
