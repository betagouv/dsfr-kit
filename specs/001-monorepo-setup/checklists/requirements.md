# Specification Quality Checklist: Monorepo Setup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 17, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

âœ… **All validation checks passed**

### Content Quality Assessment
- Specification focuses on workspace management, build orchestration, and developer experience
- No specific implementation details (Turborepo, pnpm, uv are mentioned in user input but spec remains tool-agnostic)
- Written in terms of developer needs and system capabilities
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 12 functional requirements are testable and specific
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (time, behavior verification)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "packages build in topological order" vs "Turborepo builds packages")
- Three user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases identified for circular dependencies, conflicts, failures, publishing, and branch switching
- Scope clearly bounded to monorepo setup and build orchestration
- Key entities defined with clear relationships

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories cover initialization (P1), build orchestration (P2), and multi-language support (P3)
- Success criteria provide measurable outcomes for all major capabilities
- Specification maintains abstraction from implementation details

## Notes

Specification is ready for planning phase. No updates required.
