# Implementation Plan: Monorepo Setup

**Branch**: `001-monorepo-setup` | **Date**: October 17, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-monorepo-setup/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Establish a Turborepo-based monorepo structure supporting both Node.js/TypeScript (pnpm) and Python (uv) packages with automated build orchestration, caching, and multi-language ecosystem support. The workspace will use `apps/` for deployable applications and `packages/` for shared libraries, with strict dependency version enforcement and intelligent build failure handling.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Node.js 22+ (TypeScript 5+), Python 3.11+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Turborepo (build orchestration), pnpm (Node.js package manager), uv (Python package manager)  
**Storage**: Local filesystem cache (.turbo/), designed for optional remote cache extension (Vercel or S3-compatible)  
**Testing**: Workspace validation scripts, build verification tests  
**Target Platform**: macOS, Linux, Windows (cross-platform development environments)  
**Project Type**: Monorepo infrastructure (foundational setup for multi-package workspace)  
**Performance Goals**: <5s cached builds, <30s package recognition, parallel task execution  
**Constraints**: Single version per dependency across workspace, no circular dependencies, local-first with optional remote cache  
**Scale/Scope**: Support for 10+ packages initially, scalable to 50+ packages, both JavaScript/TypeScript and Python ecosystems

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle IV: Monorepo Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Status**: ✅ **PASS** - This feature directly implements the constitutional requirement

**Alignment**:
- ✅ Using Turborepo for build orchestration and caching (required)
- ✅ Using pnpm workspaces for Node.js/TypeScript packages (required)
- ✅ Using uv workspaces for Python packages (required)
- ✅ Explicit package dependency declaration via workspace configuration
- ✅ Build tasks designed for cacheability and parallelization

**Rationale**: This feature establishes the foundational monorepo infrastructure mandated by the constitution, enabling all future multi-framework component development.

### Principle V: Code Quality & Consistency

**Status**: ✅ **PASS** - Will be addressed in subsequent features

**Notes**: This infrastructure feature sets up the workspace structure. Linting/formatting tools (Biome, Ruff) will be configured in follow-up tasks once packages are created.

### Other Principles

**Status**: ⚪ **NOT APPLICABLE** - Infrastructure setup phase

**Notes**: Principles I-III (component generation, extensibility, styling) and VI-X (package independence, source alignment, behavioral fidelity, accessibility, inspiration) apply to component implementation features, not infrastructure setup.

```

**Structure Decision**: Monorepo workspace structure with clear separation between deployable applications (`apps/`) and shared libraries (`packages/`). This aligns with constitutional Principle IV and clarification decisions from the specification phase. The structure supports both Node.js/TypeScript (via pnpm) and Python (via uv) packages in a unified workspace managed by Turborepo.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

**Status**: ✅ No constitutional violations - this feature directly implements required infrastructure.
