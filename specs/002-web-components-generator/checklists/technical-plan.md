# Technical Plan Quality Checklist: Web Components Generator Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate technical plan completeness, architecture clarity, and implementation readiness before task generation  
**Created**: October 18, 2025  
**Feature**: [plan.md](../plan.md)  
**Rigor Level**: Lightweight pre-implementation sanity check  
**Focus**: Integration risks, architecture completeness, implementation readiness

## Architecture Completeness

- [ ] **CHK001**: Are all core modules (fetcher, parsers, token_mapper, generator, validator) assigned clear, single responsibilities? [Clarity - Plan §Module Responsibilities]
- [x] **CHK002**: Is the data flow from DSFR assets → parsed tokens → Tailwind config → generated components explicitly documented? [Completeness - Plan §Data Flow Architecture]
- [x] **CHK003**: Are error handling strategies defined for each major pipeline stage (fetch, parse, generate, validate)? [Completeness - Plan §Error Handling Strategy]
- [ ] **CHK004**: Is the caching strategy (location, invalidation rules, size limits) fully specified? [Clarity - Plan §fetcher/cache.py]
- [ ] **CHK005**: Are all template variables for Jinja2 templates (`web_component.j2`, `story.j2`) documented? [Completeness - Gap]

## Integration Risks

- [ ] **CHK006**: Is the Python-TypeScript subprocess integration mechanism (command format, JSON schema, error handling) completely specified? [Clarity - Plan §Integration Flow]
- [ ] **CHK007**: Are GitHub API authentication, rate limiting, and failure recovery strategies defined? [Completeness - Plan §fetcher/github.py]
- [ ] **CHK008**: Is the DSFR version pinning mechanism (v1.12.0) enforced at all asset fetch points? [Consistency - Plan §config.py]
- [ ] **CHK009**: Are axe-core integration details (subprocess vs Python bindings, output parsing) specified? [Clarity - Plan §validator/accessibility.py]
- [x] **CHK010**: Is the fallback behavior defined when TypeScript JS analyzer (P3) is not available? [Completeness - Plan §Fallback Strategy]

## Dependency Management

- [ ] **CHK011**: Are all Python dependencies (Beautiful Soup 4, tinycss2, Jinja2, Click/Typer) version-pinned in plan? [Completeness - Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] **CHK012**: Are all TypeScript dependencies (TypeScript Compiler API) version-pinned in plan? [Completeness - Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] **CHK013**: Is the Node.js version requirement specified for TypeScript tooling? [Completeness - Gap]
- [ ] **CHK014**: Are testing framework versions (pytest, vitest, axe-core) specified? [Completeness - Plan §Technical Context]

## Implementation Readiness

- [ ] **CHK015**: Are performance goals (<30s component generation, <10s token extraction) measurable and testable? [Measurability - Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] **CHK016**: Is the CLI command structure (`dsfr-kit generate`, `init`, `config`) fully defined with all arguments and options? [Completeness - Plan §CLI Application]
- [ ] **CHK017**: Are all constitutional principles (I-XI) validated with concrete evidence from the plan? [Consistency - Plan §Constitution Check]
- [ ] **CHK018**: Is the monorepo package structure (apps/, libs/, packages/) consistent with existing dsfr-kit layout? [Consistency - Plan §Project Structure]
- [ ] **CHK019**: Are installation methods (end-user, development, one-time) tested and documented? [Completeness - Plan §main.py]
- [ ] **CHK020**: Is the DSFR Button component (P1 target) complexity appropriate for architecture validation? [Scope - Spec §User Story 1]

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes

- [ ] **CHK021**: Is behavior defined when DSFR assets are missing, malformed, or incompatible with parser? [Coverage - Plan §Edge Cases]
- [ ] **CHK022**: Is behavior defined when generated components fail RGAA 4 validation (FR-025)? [Coverage - Spec §FR-025]
- [ ] **CHK023**: Is behavior defined when Tailwind cannot express required DSFR styling? [Coverage - Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] **CHK024**: Is behavior defined when DSFR releases a new version with breaking changes? [Coverage - Spec §Edge Cases]

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] **CHK025**: Are unit test boundaries defined for each module (parsers, token_mapper, generator)? [Completeness - Gap]
- [ ] **CHK026**: Are integration test scenarios defined for the full generation pipeline? [Completeness - Gap]
- [ ] **CHK027**: Is the accessibility testing approach (automated + manual) clearly specified? [Clarity - Plan §validator/]
- [ ] **CHK028**: Are test fixtures (sample DSFR assets) sourced and versioned? [Completeness - Plan §libs/dsfr-generator/tests/fixtures/]

## Notes

**Critical Gaps Addressed** (October 18, 2025):
- ✅ Data flow diagram added (CHK002) - Plan §Data Flow Architecture
- ✅ Error handling strategy documented (CHK003) - Plan §Error Handling Strategy  
- ✅ TypeScript analyzer fallback behavior defined (CHK010) - Plan §Fallback Strategy

**Remaining Gaps** (Acceptable for task generation):
- Template variable documentation missing (CHK005) - Can be defined during implementation
- Node.js version requirement missing (CHK013) - Can be specified in package.json during setup
- Testing strategy needs detail (CHK025-CHK028) - Will be defined in task breakdown

**Strengths**:
- Module responsibilities clearly defined
- Constitutional compliance thoroughly validated
- Installation methods well-documented
- Performance goals measurable
- Data flow explicitly documented
- Comprehensive error handling strategy

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR TASK GENERATION** - Critical blockers resolved, remaining gaps are implementation details that can be addressed during task execution.
