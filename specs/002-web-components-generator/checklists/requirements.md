# Spec Quality Checklist: Web Components Generator Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate specification quality and completeness before proceeding to planning phase  
**Created**: October 18, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, tools) in requirements
- [x] Requirements focus on user value and business outcomes
- [x] Specification is written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections are completed (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain in specification
- [x] All functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined with Given/When/Then format
- [x] Edge cases are identified and documented
- [x] Feature scope and boundaries are clearly defined
- [x] Key entities are documented with clear definitions

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User stories cover primary workflows and are prioritized (P1-P4)
- [x] Feature delivers measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
- [x] Each user story is independently testable

## Validation Notes

**Validation Date**: October 18, 2025

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories with P1-P4 labels
- Comprehensive functional requirements organized by category (Core, Token Mapping, Web Component, Documentation, QA)
- All 8 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases cover important scenarios (version updates, missing assets, accessibility)
- Key entities are well-defined with clear relationships

**Status**: âœ… **READY FOR NEXT PHASE**

The specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` (if needed) or `/speckit.plan` (to proceed with technical design).

## Next Steps

1. **Optional**: Run `/speckit.clarify` if any aspects need further clarification
2. **Recommended**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create technical design and implementation plan
3. **Future**: After plan is complete, use `/speckit.tasks` to generate actionable task list
