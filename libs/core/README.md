# dsfr-kit (Python)

This package serves as the foundation for the future Python implementation of `dsfr-kit`.

## Roadmap

The goal is to support Python-based web frameworks by providing native DSFR components:

- **Streamlit**: Custom components for Streamlit applications.
- **Reflex**: Fully typed components for Reflex.
- **Flask/Django**: Jinja2 templates and utility helpers.

## Current Status

🚧 **Placeholder**: This directory currently holds the core structure for the Python workspace. Active development is scheduled for the next phase.
