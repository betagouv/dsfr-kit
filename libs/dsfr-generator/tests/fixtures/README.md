# Test Fixtures

This directory contains sample DSFR assets for testing purposes.

## Structure

- `button/` - Sample DSFR Button component assets
  - `button.html` - HTML template
  - `button.scss` - SCSS styles
  - `button.js` - JavaScript behaviors

## Usage

These fixtures are used by unit and integration tests to verify parsing and generation functionality without requiring network access to fetch real DSFR assets.

## Source

Fixtures are extracted from official DSFR releases and should be updated when the target DSFR version changes (currently v1.14.2).
